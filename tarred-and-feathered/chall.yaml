  i recently exfiltrated this archive from a suspect's computer. they illegally stole all of our flags.

  however, not everything is as it seems. the flag is in the archive, but where? i couldn't find it, can you?
hints:
  - Not everything in the archive is what it seems. Look beyond the visible files.
  - how can you get more information about what files are in the archive?

  - src: ./challenge.tar.gz
