to solve this, you really just need to
1) figure out that it is the ethereum virtual machine and look for a decompiler/disassembler
    - dedaub is a nice online one in my experience
    - also, you may experience it decompiling something that's not the flagchecker function, just delete bytes up to another starting (i forgot, its like 0x6080 or smth)
2) just rev from here, see solve.py for how you can reverse the operations on the stored "encrypted" flag to get the original flag

if anyone can find something like a debugger for evm then you could just place a breakpoint ig but idk if those exist at all
