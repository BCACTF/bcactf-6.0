  Timmy Bobbins is struggling to pass his alchemy class. His teacher lets him
  retake the final exam as many times as he wants, but the questions are uniquely
  generated every time Timmy begins the exam. If Timmy's parents find out that he
  didn't pass the class, they will be very disappointed. Help Timmy score 25/25
  on his impossible final exam so he can make his parents proud!
