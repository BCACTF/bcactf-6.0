  I found the secret compound that Generic Perfume Corp. uses in their products. Unfortunately, it seems to be hashed. 
  I believe the compound is a relatively well-known chemical and the plaintext is the compound's canonical SMILES string.
  Can you find the name of this mystery compound given its hash (in SHA256)?
  Wrap the common name (i.e. excluding words that distinguish stereoisomers) of the compound in bcactf{} and make everything lowercase
  
hints:
  - Have you looked through any chemistry databases?
