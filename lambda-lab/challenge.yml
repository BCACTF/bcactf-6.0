  One of the last assignments for computer science of junior year for ATCS students is the lambda lab. We are tasked with using lambda calculus
  to make a REPL. I finished my lab, but I included a little easter egg! Can you find it?

  To find the secret, run the following
  run (+ (+ (car (cdr (cons 1 (cons 125 2)))) (- (* 3 14) (factorial 0))) (cdr (cons 1 1)))
