  the BIA (bca intelligence agency) is stepping it up.
  we recently infiltrated the **un**official government agency SIA!

  we extracted a number of "state secrets". it's said the flag can be found among them. but i can't open anything...
hints:
  - do you know what hash cracking is? all passwords (if blind cracking) can be found in `rockyou.txt`. take a look at john the ripper / hashcat.
  - if you are having trouble constructing the flag, remember that there might be some underscores you missed. also, the flag is a valid english statement in l33t sp34k
  - if you are stuck on the last part of the flag check the "docx theme cache"
