first disassemble binary to realize that you can use --access to dump an encrypted flag. this is XORed with 0x2A to begin, and you generate a key based on the identifier, which is used to XOR the data again. it is also shifted and transformed in a reversible way (add 0x10 and XOR w/ key)

see solve.py which will be released at end for example solution
