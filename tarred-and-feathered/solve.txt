use `tar -tzf challenge.tar.gz` to see that there is a hidden file in a parent directory
it has a zero-width space so u have to be careful when reading the flag
you will only see the note.txt when you extract normally cuz the other is in a parent directory
then js read the flag

===== from mudasir =====
tar tvf challenge.tar.gz # list out files
mkdir challenge # create folder to store output
gunzip challenge.tar.gz # convert tar.gz to .tar
tar -Pxf challenge.tar --transform='s/.*\///' --force-local -C challenge # extract tar to subfolder, flattening directory structure
