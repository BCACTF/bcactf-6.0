description: 'Attend, brave soul, to this melodic quest,

  Where riddles lie in symphony''s soft crest.

  The audio''s dawn, not music but a code,

  Doth whisper secrets in a hex-lit mode.


  Yet once that cryptic veil is swept away,

  A master''s hand begins a bold balletâ€”

  Rachmaninoff, in fervent, grand display,

  His Third Concerto''s first proud arc doth play.


  So listen well, where numbers speak in tone,

  Then let the maestro''s tempest guide you home.
