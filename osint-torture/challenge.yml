description: "I got bored and made a little something. It may not be easy though!\n\
  This challenge consists of **3 parts**.\n  - For part 1, I require the name of this\
  \ famous historical game. When you type it in, do NOT have spaces. Use correct capitalization.\
  \ PascalCase. An example of such a game might be TheImmortalGame.\n  - For part\
  \ 2, I require just the number of the address I must contact if I want to visit\
  \ this company. That is, if the \"company\" was Bergen County Academies, the number\
  \ might be 200.\n  - For part 3, I am looking for ONE key word. You will know what\
  \ the word is when you get it. Put it uppercase. By \"you will know\", you will\
  \ find something online that explicitly says something along the lines of \"the\
  \ word you are looking for is:\".\n\nSeparate the parts with underscores. \n\nNote:\
  \ Once you solve the challenge, open a ticket, and I’ll allow you to do “part4”\
  \ for a special badge I’ll mail you! “part4” is not part of the flag though, it’s\
  \ just for fun :) \n\nExample flag: *bcactf{ImmortalGame_67_ORZ}*"
