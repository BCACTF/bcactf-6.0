  I got bored and made a little something. It may not be easy though!
  This challenge consists of **3 parts**.
    - For part 1, I require the name of this famous game. When you type it in, do NOT have spaces. Use correct capitalization. PascalCase.
    - For part 2, I require just the number of the address I must contact if I want to visit this company.
    - For part 3, I am looking for ONE key word. You will know what the word is when you get it. Separate the parts with underscores. Put it uppercase.

  Note: Once you solve the challenge, open a ticket, and I’ll allow you to do “part4” for a special badge I’ll mail you! “part4” is not part of the flag though, it’s just for fun :) 

  Example flag: *bcactf{ImmortalGame_67_ORZ}*
