  I've made an amazing new encryption software to share information with my bestest friend! 
  my username is `hun73r12` and my best friend's username is `__purten75`.
  but, i forgot to code up the decryption logic.... that makes it even more secure!!
  here's the encrypted flag and the binary I used to encrypt the flag to share with `__purten75`!

  (you can see the information in info.txt if needed)
  `08544f76b472694f3c03045c1b4aa6246027635f59684626f1644d016442355a5b20f74b2a4b0b5a13684026b74b2a4b610035515c24f37a7605`
hints:
  - try analyzing the binary's encryption logic (free online dissassembler at [cloud.binary.ninja](https://cloud.binary.ninja/))
  - Have you tried analyzing how the binary works? You don't really need to run the binary for anything
