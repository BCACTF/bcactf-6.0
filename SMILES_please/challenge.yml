description: "I found the secret compound that Generic Perfume Corp. uses in their\
  \ products. Unfortunately, it seems to be hashed. \nI believe the compound is a\
  \ relatively well-known chemical and the plaintext is the compound's canonical SMILES\
  \ string.\nCan you find the name of this mystery compound given its hash (in SHA256)?\n\
  Wrap the common name (i.e. excluding words that distinguish stereoisomers) of the\
  \ compound in bcactf{} and make everything lowercase"
