  I was watching some YouTube Shorts. The flag is:

  1) the FULL username of the channel I was watching
  2) what are they the king of?
  3) the FULL username of their closest associate


  All lowercase, seperate the three parts by underscores, 
  use spaces if any answer to the parts is more than one word.

  Example:
  1) MrBeast
  2) England
  3) johnny sinner

  `bcactf{mrbeast_england_johnny sinner}`
  
  I can guarentee it is not ambigious.
hints:
  - no hints needed. just be more brainrotted.
