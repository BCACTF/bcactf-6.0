description: 'I couldn''t afford the new Mario Kart game, so my friend gave me a copy
  of Nitro Nexus.

  I''m a GOD at racing games, but theres only one problem... I can''t get past the
  first level.

  The builds can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L39C3J49w4awgTqAO-UCdICT79UQ_9WK?usp=sharing)'
