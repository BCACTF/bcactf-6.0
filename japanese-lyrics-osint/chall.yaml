  Out of the top 25 most streamed songs in Japan according to Wikipedia,
  we picked a song (with Japanese lyrics) and translated a line from Japanese to English
  using various large language models. Here were the results (each line is a different translation):
  
  An unending, unending flavor has seeped in.
  There's a taste that won't go away, it's stained into me.
  The taste that won't disappear, won't disappear, has soaked in deeply.
  The taste that doesn't fade, doesn't fade, is deeply ingrained.

  What is the name of the song, according to its English Wikipedia page?
  Wrap the name in bcactf{}. It's case-sensitive, so please follow the case
  as it is on Wikipedia.
hints:
  - The difficulty in this challenge perhaps lies in gathering the lyrics to the top 25 most streamed songs. But maybe there's an easy way to get that done?
  - The same word is translated as "unending", "won't go away", "won't disappear", and "doesn't fade". It may be worth finding out what word that is.
  - What is the Japanese word for flavor/taste?
