this is made by colin btw just some notes on how i actually solved it

part 1:
look at the arrows, you can assume white played e4, a bit of time on lichess opening explorer (if thats what its called) can let you guess the opening is the silician dragon

IMPORTANT: you need to count the total arrows to see how many moves were actually shown on the arrows. this can cause misconceptions

one thing to note is that black moved the e pawn. this can help with searching

you can narrow down the opening, then you just need to spend some time on the chessgames database looking through games. also note the rook b8 move from black, can help you in searching

took me probably 30m-1hr to find Stop Dragon My Heart Around



part 2:
tbh you can easily guess that it is ABG Commercial Real Estate
just a google search until you find the matching logo gives you the website, going to contact page gives you the address easily


part 3:
searching the string gives you lyrics. here it is guessy tbh, and i think being clued by chall author helped me a lot, and i think it would have taken much more time wihtout clues

anyways it leads to a reddit suername iwth the artist of the song (ZHOUYIFANBCA) or smth, and you can see that it tells you to join tienxion's discord server in his profile

the server icon is a album cover i think and you search that up to see him commenting the word BMW on the page



part 1 - time consuming, but nice
part 2 - easy, nice
part 3 - kinda cursed ngl, probably the hardest part due to ambiguity
