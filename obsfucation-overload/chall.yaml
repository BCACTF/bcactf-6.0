  I've made an amazing new encryption software to share information with my bestest friend! 
  my username is `tienorz1234` and my best friend's username is `n006wm_backwards`.
  but, i forgot to code up the decryption logic.... that makes it even more secure!!
  here's the encrypted flag and the binary I used to encrypt the flag to share with `n006wm_backwards`!

  (you can see the information in info.txt if needed)
  `db7a2f75cf1bdb62f625d3f7f10a852ae67e7e26d522913df62e8bb0a62786458a6f7d64c219942af630d7f8f627dc2ecf64`
hints:
  - Ghidra is a free binary dissassembler and analyzer (u can try Binary Ninja too) or ida or smth
  - Have you tried analyzing how the binary works? You don't really need to run the binary for anything
