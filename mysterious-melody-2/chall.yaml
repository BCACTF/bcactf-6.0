description: |-
  Attend, brave soul, to this melodic quest,
  Where riddles lie in symphony's soft crest.
  The audio's dawn, not music but a code,
  Doth whisper secrets in a hex-lit mode.

  Yet once that cryptic veil is swept away,
  A master's hand begins a bold balletâ€”
  Rachmaninoff, in fervent, grand display,
  His Third Concerto's first proud arc doth play.

  So listen well, where numbers speak in tone,
  Then let the maestro's tempest guide you home.
  
  The flag should be enclosed in bcactf{}.
hints:
  - Are all the numbers prime?
  - What are the indices of the non-prime numbers
