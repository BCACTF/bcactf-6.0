  here at the prestigious Bergen County Academies, a group of underground engineers has created:

  the world's first **5D PRINTER!!!!**

  i made some gcode and a 5MF file, and printed it. it gave me the flag!! too bad u dont have a 5d printer LMAO!
  
hints:
  - have you actually looked at the provided "source" yet smh??
  - figure out what the other two dimensions are used for
  - try going to micro center and buying a 5d printer, then just run the GCODE
files:
  - src: ./flag.5mf
  - src: ./source.py
