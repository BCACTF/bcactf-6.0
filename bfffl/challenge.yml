description: "I've made an amazing new encryption software to share information with\
  \ my bestest friend! \nmy username is `hun73r12` and my best friend's username is\
  \ `__purten75`.\nbut, i forgot to code up the decryption logic.... that makes it\
  \ even more secure!!\nhere's the encrypted flag and the binary I used to encrypt\
  \ the flag to share with `__purten75`!\n\n(you can see the information in info.txt\
  \ if needed)\n`08544f76b472694f3c03045c1b4aa6246027635f59684626f1644d016442355a5b20f74b2a4b0b5a13684026b74b2a4b610035515c24f37a7605`"

hints:
- try analyzing the binary's encryption logic (free online dissassembler at [cloud.binary.ninja](https://cloud.binary.ninja/))
- Have you tried analyzing how the binary works? You don't really need to run the
  binary for anything
