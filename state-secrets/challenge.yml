hints:
- do you know what hash cracking is? all passwords (if blind cracking) can be found
  in `rockyou.txt`. take a look at john the ripper / hashcat.
- if you are having trouble constructing the flag, remember that there might be some
  underscores you missed. also, the flag is a valid english statement in l33t sp34k
- if you are stuck on the last part of the flag check the "docx theme cache"
