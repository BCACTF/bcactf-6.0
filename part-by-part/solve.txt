Every class in JVM bytecode includes the "sourcefile" attribute, which contains
the name of the Java file from which the class was compiled. When an exception
is thrown and a stack trace is printed, the "sourcefile" attribute of each class
in the stack trace is printed along with the class name.

Example:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:964)
Note how Scanner.java is printed in the stacktrace.

In the JAR file included in this challenge, the classes Part1, Part2, Part3, and
Part4 have had their sourcefile attributes manually set to the respective pieces
of the flag. You can reveal this attribute by either using a bytecode editor to
analyze each class, or by causing the application to throw an exception and print
a stack trace.

To print part 1 of the flag, select 1 in the program's command line interface.
Then, type an invalid input (non-integer). As a result, the program will throw
an exception, and a stack trace will be printed. The first part of the flag will
be visible in the stacktrace.

Do this for each part of the program to get the full flag.
