  This challenge involves a scrambled flag. Your task is to unscramble it and retrieve the original flag.
  The flag was scrambled by reversing the string, swapping the case, and replacing underscores with spaces.
  
  To solve it, you need to reverse the steps to get the flag back in its original form. Once you do, you should be able to see the flag!
  
  The flag will be saved in a file called **flag.txt**. Your goal is to unscramble it and find the correct flag.

hints:
  - Try reversing the string and swapping the case.
  - Don't forget to replace spaces back with underscores after unscrambling!
