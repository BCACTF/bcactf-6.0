It is impossible to beat the game in under 15 seconds, so one must edit the time limit.

1. Use a .net decompiler like dnSpy to open the game executable.
2. Search for the time limit variable (under the "Objective" class).
3. Edit the value to a higher number and save.
4. Beat the game in order to read the flag.
