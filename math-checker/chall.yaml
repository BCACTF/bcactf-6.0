  My math teacher made this program to check a math problem. Unfortunately, he designed it
  before the C Programming Language was made, so I can't really decompile it that well.
  Can you figure out the correct answer? 
  
  (Wrap the 5-digit answer in the flag format, so if the correct program input were `12345`, the flag would 
  be `bcactf{12345}`)
hints:
  - No hints, good luck!
