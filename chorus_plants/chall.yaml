  Found this drawn in a book in the end. 
  It had strange symbols and some of them had numbers underneath
  I assume the numbers correlate to a single letter
  Redrew this on the whiteboard so that I could show it to you.
  Can you figure out what the inscription means?
  
hints:
  - The sticks with the Xs through them can be safely ignored (they are there for extension purposes)
  - What other tree appears in elementary/primary school math? (tree represents in a similar format but with factors)
