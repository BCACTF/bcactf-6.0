  I couldn't afford the new Mario Kart game, so my friend gave me a copy of Nitro Nexus.
  I'm a GOD at racing games, but theres only one problem... I can't get past the first level.
  The builds can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L39C3J49w4awgTqAO-UCdICT79UQ_9WK?usp=sharing)
hints:
  - There is no way anyone can beat the game in the time alloted.
  - If only there was a way to slow down time... or increase the time limit.
