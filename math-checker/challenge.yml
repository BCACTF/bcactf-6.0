description: "My math teacher made this program to check a math problem. Unfortunately,\
  \ he designed it\nbefore the C Programming Language was made, so I can't really\
  \ decompile it that well.\nCan you figure out the correct answer? \n\n(Wrap the\
  \ answer in the flag format, so if the correct program input were `123`, the flag\
  \ would \nbe `bcactf{123}`)"
